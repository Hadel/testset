Specification
=============

The test-set is based on the requirements document developed in the Beter
Benutten MMRI project. The document contains an informal set of requirements,
which this project attempts to formalize and test.

The formalization of the requirements is written in LaTeX and can be found
under :file:`specs/testset.tex`. Every requirement is tested as a single
testcase and is defined as a transit graph, a list of planning requests and
the correct results.
