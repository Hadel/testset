  GTFS

    The General Transit Feed Specification defines a common format for public
    transportation schedules and associated geographic information. GTFS
    "feeds" allow public transit agencies to publish their transit data and
    developers to write applications that consume that data in an
    interoperable way.

  GTFS-RT

    GTFS-realtime is a feed specification that allows public transportation
    agencies to provide realtime updates about their fleet to application
    developers. It is an extension to GTFS (General Transit Feed
    Specification), an open data format for public transportation schedules
    and associated geographic information. GTFS-realtime was designed around
    ease of implementation, good GTFS interoperability and a focus on
    passenger information.
